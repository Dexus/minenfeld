# MINENFIELD
This is a prototype game inspired by the Minesweeper. You have to cross the minefield and get on the other side. The levels are randomly generated, but I using an A* Algorithm to validate that exists a way to complete it.

## Gameplay
In the original Minesweeper the objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. But in this game the character have to cross the minefield.

## Controls
+ Arrows or Swipe: to move character in each direction;
+ Click or Tap: to set a 'flag' (just change the color of tile).
